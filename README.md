# Game Programming F22 Project - Pok√©mon Tower Defense

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description
In this tower defense styled game, players will become Pok√©mon trainers and use their Pok√©mon to defend cities against enraged and invasive Pok√©mon species. Players choose their team of up to 6 Pok√©mon and defend against waves of incoming wild Pok√©mon. Players are able to place their Pok√©mon on highlighted squares and can move them as they please. 

Wild Pok√©mon try to get to the other side of the map and pick up a rare candy. Once they pick a rare candy up they bring it back to their spawn. Should they succeed they come right back and try to get another one. Should they faint on their route, they drop the rare candy and another Pok√©mon can pick up where the other one left off. 

The player loses the level when all the rare candies are stolen. The player wins the level when all the incoming waves of Pok√©mon are defeated.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay
The game begins with the player picking a name and a starter Pok√©mon. They are immediately thrusted into the first level where they need to prevent a swarm of Pok√©mon from stealing professor oak's rare candies. Each wild Pok√©mon will run from the start to the end of the level, pick up a rare candy, then run back to the beginning of the level and continue. The game loop includes the player placing their Pok√©mon in set locations (tower locations). These tower locations change depending on the layout of the map. After placing their Pok√©mon, they are treated as "towers". When a wild Pok√©mon comes in range of one of your towers, your Pok√©mon will attack it. You can also select a placed Pok√©mon to pick from their list of 4 attacks. They will then use the selected attack when wild Pok√©mon come in range.

Each wild Pok√©mon's health is indicated by a health bar above their heads. When they get below 20% hp, the health bar turns from green to red and they can be caught. To catch a Pok√©mon, the player uses the pok√© ball available in the bottom right of the UI. By clicking and holding on the pok√© ball, the player starts the catching state. In this state, the game is paused, and the player can hover the pok√© ball over the Pok√©mon they want to catch them. When the ball is hovering over a Pok√©mon with <= 20% hp, and they release the mouse, the Pok√©mon will be caught. If there is room in the player's party, the Pok√©mon will be added directly there, otherwise it can be found in the pc.

A level is won when all the wild Pok√©mon are reduced to 0 hitpoints. Contrarily, the level is lost if all the rare candies are stolen by the Pok√©mon. At the end of a level, the player is brought to the level select stage. Here, they can view future levels, but can not select them since they are locked. After winning a level, the next one is unlocked. The goal of the game is to make your way through the levels, catching Pok√©mon as you go.

Finally, your Pok√©mon can level up and evolve. As they defeat wild Pok√©mon, they will gain experience. Once they're gained enough experience, the player will be notified that their Pok√©mon can level up. To level up, the player needs to spend currency (Pok√©dollars). These Pok√©dollars are gained by defeating wild Pok√©mon. If the Pok√©mon is at a level where levelling up will cause them to evolve, the "level up" indication will instead display "Evolve" and the price to level up will increase.

We used [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create our wireframe diagrams as well as our class diagrams. 
We plan on following the original games mechanics 
which are shared amongst most tower defense style games.
